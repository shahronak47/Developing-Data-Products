This is a simple shiny application which shows the histogram of geyser eruption duration (in minutes) against its density. 
The application gives you the choice to select the number of bars in histogram. Also it has two checkboxes which allows you to 
select individual observations and the density estimate as a sine wave. If you check on the density estimate checkbox it would 
give you a sine wave of density and also a slider at the bottom from where you can adjust the bandwidth.
